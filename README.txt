This does Cyclic Coordinate Descent to move a 3 link arm with 3 revolute joints to find a point specified by the user.

It supports joint limits, though none are currently imposed (they're all set to infinity).

Overtime this will hopefully become more configurable, as well as implementing various other algorithms.
